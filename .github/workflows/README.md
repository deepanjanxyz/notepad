# GitHub Actions workflows

This directory holds every CI/CD workflow for Elite Memo Pro. Each file has a
single responsibility, so it is easy to see what runs, when, and why.

## Index — which file does which job

| Workflow file | Name | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`ci.yml`](./ci.yml) | CI | `push` / `pull_request` to `dev` and `main`, plus manual | Runs the unit tests and a debug build, then uploads the test reports. This is the build-verification gate. |
| [`android.yml`](./android.yml) | Build and Sign APK | manual (`workflow_dispatch`) | Builds the unsigned release APK, decodes the keystore from secrets, signs the APK, and uploads it as the `release-apk` artifact. |
| [`mirror.yml`](./mirror.yml) | Multi-Platform Smart Auto Mirroring | `push` of any branch or tag | Materializes every branch locally, then mirrors all branches and tags to GitLab and Codeberg (force-syncing when a normal push is rejected). |
| [`universal-pr-check.yml`](./universal-pr-check.yml) | Universal PR Check | `pull_request` (opened, synchronize, reopened) to `dev` | Runs the build, unit tests, lint, detekt and a secret scan as parallel jobs on JDK 17, then posts a single status-table comment on the PR and blocks the merge if any check fails. |

## In one line each

- **Tests / verification** → `ci.yml`
- **Release build + signing** → `android.yml`
- **Mirroring (push) to other hosts (GitLab, Codeberg)** → `mirror.yml`
- **Per-PR parallel gate with a unified status report** → `universal-pr-check.yml`

## Required repository secrets

| Secret | Used by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `KEYSTORE_BASE64` | `android.yml`, `universal-pr-check.yml` | Base64-encoded release keystore. |
| `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | `android.yml`, `universal-pr-check.yml` | Release keystore password. |
| `KEY_ALIAS` | `android.yml`, `universal-pr-check.yml` | Release key alias. |
| `KEY_PASSWORD` | `android.yml`, `universal-pr-check.yml` | Release key password. |
| `GITLAB_TOKEN` | `mirror.yml` | Push access to the GitLab mirror. |
| `CODEBERG_TOKEN` | `mirror.yml` | Push access to the Codeberg mirror. |

## Universal PR Check (`universal-pr-check.yml`)

A branch-scoped gate that runs on every pull request targeting `dev`. All build,
test and inspection tasks run as **parallel jobs**, so the suite finishes in the
time of its slowest job rather than the sum of all of them, and the outcome is
reported back onto the PR as a single status table.

**Trigger.** `pull_request` events only, of type `opened`, `synchronize`, and
`reopened`, limited to pull requests whose base branch is `dev`. It deliberately
does not run on plain `push`.

**Parallel jobs.**

| Job | Command / action | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Debug & Release build | `./gradlew assembleDebug assembleRelease --no-daemon --parallel` | Decodes the release keystore from `KEYSTORE_BASE64` and exposes `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`, `KEY_PASSWORD` to Gradle so the release variant is signed, not just assembled. |
| Unit tests | `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest --no-daemon --parallel` | |
| Android lint | `./gradlew lintDebug --no-daemon` | Counts lint warnings so the report can flag non-blocking issues. |
| Static analysis (detekt) | `./gradlew detekt --no-daemon` | Runs only when detekt is configured in the project; skipped otherwise. |
| Secret scan | `gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v3` | Scans the checkout for hardcoded secrets. |

**Environment.** Every job runs on `ubuntu-latest`, checks out with full history
(`fetch-depth: 0`), sets up Temurin **JDK 17**, and configures Gradle caching via
`gradle/actions/setup-gradle`. The JDK is pinned to **17** on purpose: the project
compiles against `sourceCompatibility`/`targetCompatibility` 17 and must not be
silently upgraded to a newer JDK. The Android SDK platform the project builds
against (`compileSdk`) is installed before the Gradle build.

**Permissions.** `contents: read`, `pull-requests: write`, and `issues: write` —
just enough to read the code and write feedback back onto the pull request.

**Status report.** A final job waits for every parallel job and creates or
updates a single Markdown table comment on the PR. Each row uses a status
indicator:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🟢 | Passed — clean execution. |
| 🟡 | Warning — non-blocking warnings (e.g. lint suggestions). |
| 🔴 | Failed — blocking error. |
| ⚪ | Skipped / N/A — optional or unconfigured task. |

When every check passes, a thumbs up (`+1`) reaction is added to the PR. If any
check fails, its job fails and the merge button stays blocked until it is fixed.
